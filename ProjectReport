Project Title: Data Science Salary Analysis (2020-2024)
Duration: January 2024 - March 2024
Project Overview:
The "Data Science Salary Analysis" project aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of salary trends within the data science industry from 2020 to 2024. Utilizing extensive data sets from various industry sources, this project focused on visualizing salary variations across different job titles, experience levels, work modes, and geographical locations within the United States. The insights gathered were designed to help professionals and employers understand the evolving compensation landscape in the field of data science.

Objectives:
Analyze and compare salary trends across different data science roles including Data Scientist, Data Engineer, AI Engineer, and Machine Learning Specialist.
Investigate salary growth over five years to determine the fastest-growing roles in terms of compensation.
Evaluate the impact of experience level and job mode (full-time, part-time, contract) on salaries.
Highlight geographical differences in data science salaries across various states and countries.
Data Sources and Tools:
Data Collection: Salary data was aggregated from multiple industry surveys, employment websites, and direct company disclosures.
Data Processing and Analysis: Data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Python and SQL.
Visualization Tool: Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard providing a clear visual representation of salary trends and distributions.
Key Findings:
Salary Growth: AI Engineers showed the highest salary growth rate of over 300% between 2020 and 2024, emphasizing the increasing demand for AI expertise.
Experience Impact: Salaries for data science roles generally increased with experience, with executive-level AI Engineers earning up to $208K, making it the highest-paid role in data science by 2024.
Job Mode Influence: Full-time roles consistently offered higher salaries compared to part-time and contract positions, with full-time Data Engineers earning an average of $157K compared to $261K for contract roles, highlighting a premium for contractual employment.
Geographical Variations: The United States maintained the highest average salary ($158K), with notable high earners in France and Puerto Rico following closely.
Methodology:
Data Integration: Utilized Azure Data Lake for storage and Azure Databricks for processing large datasets.
ETL Processes: Developed using Azure Data Factory to ensure efficient data manipulation and preparation for analysis.
Dashboard Development: Interactive dashboards were built in Tableau, allowing users to filter by job title, experience level, and location.
Challenges and Solutions:
Data Inconsistency: Encountered various data formatting issues across sources, which were mitigated by implementing stringent data validation and cleaning procedures.
Real-Time Data Integration: Faced challenges in integrating real-time data updates, resolved by automating data ingestion pipelines in Azure.
Impact:
This project significantly enhanced the understanding of salary structures within the data science community, aiding job seekers and employers alike in making informed decisions regarding career planning and salary negotiations. The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for ongoing salary assessment and planning in the data science industry.
